# dc2_satellite_census

Estimating the LSST survey selection function for resolved ultra-faint dwarf galaxies using DC2 and the Rubin Science Platform.

The simulation inputs (found in `data/`) were generated on the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).

Mock satellites will be simulated using [ugali](https://github.com/DarkEnergySurvey/ugali) and injected into DC2 at the catalog level.
